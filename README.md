# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The school district asked to analyze student data. They asked to take a snapshot of several key indicators.
After the report was compiled and reviewed by The School Board, it was determined that the data of the 9th grade of Thomas High School had apparently been altered. The School Board asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 
After that, it was needed to repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
